                    <h1> Better Credit Fix is a credit restoration firm with 18 years of experience. </h1>

                    <p>
                        We are a 95 percent referral-based company. We worked tirelessly over the years to perfect our level of service and provide robust solutions for our clients when it comes to improving their credit scores.

                        Our past experiences showed that writing dispute letters is the "lazy man's" way of attempting to fix credit; not only are the results minimal, but also the possibility of removed items being re-inserted back to credit reports is high.

                        Service and solutions are crucial, but timing and technique are also vital in helping consumers to improve their credit history. Experts at our firm continue to work diligently on acquiring new and superior knowledge concerning the credit restoration industry. They then apply that well-funded knowledge to help our client more efficiently.

                        Our experts will guide you through and strategically dispute erroneous, misleading, and unverifiable information reported on your credit reports directly with furnishers as well as with Credit Reporting Agencies. This is where our exclusive pre-litigation process has become the basis of our dispute process.

                        We have helped thousands of U.S. families to raise their credit scores even after bankruptcy, foreclosure, and other serious credit reporting issues
