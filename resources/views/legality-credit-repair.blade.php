                            <p style="text-align: justify">
                                Credit repair may not have the best reputation as financial services go, but it's a
                                federally protect right. Two primary credit repair laws guarantee consumers the right to
                                correct errors in their credit reports. They are the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA)
                                and the Credit Repair Organizations Act (CROA). There are also laws in every state that
                                regulate the credit repair industry and service providers.
                            </p>

                                It's important to note that credit repair is legal in all 50 states. There's a federal
                                law that guarantees consumers the right to dispute information in their credit report to
                                have it corrected. There's also a federal law that outlines how credit repair companies
                                can provide services to consumers. These two laws set the foundation for how credit
                                repair works in the U.S.

                                When it comes to credit repair, the Fair Credit Reporting Act outlines the process

                                    If this happens, the consumer has a right to include a 100-word statement in

                                    However, the negative information would still affect your credit score.

                            <h1>State Laws that regulate credit repair</h1>

                            <p style="text-align: justify">
                                In addition to the two federal credit repair laws, almost every state has its credit
                                repair laws, as well. Most state laws stipulate that a credit repair company must have
                                a state-licensed attorney on staff. In other words, only a credit repair attorney
                                authorized to practice in that state is legally allowed to make disputes on your behalf.
                                This gives you an easy way to make sure that a credit repair company is legitimate. If
                                they don't have state-licensed attorneys for your state on staff, then buyer beware! The
                                service may be a scam. California is not one of them.
                            </p>
                            <p style="text-align: justify">
                                Some states require the company to be bonded to work for clients in that particular
                                state. Other states establish more specific systems for when fees can be assessed and
                                prohibited acts that credit repair companies can't engage in without breaking the law.
                                Disclaimers and disclosures that are legally required can also be set by the state, as
                                well as standards for advertising and making claims during sales calls.

                            </p>

                                If you want to know your state's specific consumer protections for credit repair, contact
                                your state Attorney General's office. They can provide information about your state's
                                credit repair laws and help you understand the legalese, so you don't have to read the
                                code yourself to know what rights you have.

                                In 2018, the CFPB received over 1,000 complaints about credit repair companies. Of those,
                                one-third of the complaints were related to frauds and scams. Another 16% complained
                                about misleading advertising claims, 12% got hit with unexpected fees, and 10% did not
                                receive the proper disclosures.

                            </p>

                                Scams do happen, which is why it's so important to know your rights, both federally and
                                in your state. The benefit of correcting mistakes in your report to fix your credit is
                                immense and professional help can give you an edge. However, you don't want to add a
                                fraud complaint onto your list of financial to-dos! So, check with your State Attorney
                                General and proceed accordingly if you decide to get professional help.

                            <h1>What to do if you think you're the victim of a credit repair scam</h1>

                            <p style="text-align: justify">
                                If a company violates any of the rights outlined above or doesn't follow the laws in your
                                state, you have a right to sue and a right to file a formal complaint against the
                                company. Here's what you should do if you think a company didn't follow the letter of
                                the law and tried to scam you:

                            </p>
                            <p style="text-align: justify">
                                1.	File a complaint with the Federal Trade Commission at
                                <a href="https://www.ftccomplaintassistant.gov/" >https://www.ftccomplaintassistant.gov/</a>
                            </p>
                            <p style="text-align: justify">
                                2.	Then contact your state Attorney General's office to file a complaint with that office as well.
                            </p>
                            <p style="text-align: justify">
                                Note that complaints made to the FTC don't mean that they will help you sue the company.
                                It would be best if you usually pursued a civil lawsuit on your own. The point of filing
                                complaints is to get the company into the federal database of consumer complaints. If
                                they receive enough complaints, then they go after the company with fines and possible
                                business closure. By contrast, your state AG's office may decide to file a class-action
                                lawsuit against a company if they receive enough complaints. But if you believe you're
                                the victim of a scam, don't wait for your AG to act! Instead, talk to an attorney about
                                pursuing a civil lawsuit on your own.
