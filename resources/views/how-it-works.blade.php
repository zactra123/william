                <h1>The Credit Repair Process </h1>

                <p style="text-align: justify">
                    When you choose us to help repair your credit, we follow a three-step process to help raise your
                    score. Essentially, we look at your report and identify problematic items; work to fix those items;
                    and then double-check that credit bureaus receive up-to-date information on your credit in order to
                    raise your score. That’s the short version. Here’s the more detailed one:
                </p>

                <p style="text-align: justify">www
                    First,withyour authorization we pull your creditreports and let you highlight the items that you may
                    want to challenge or change. After you approve the scope of work to be done, we collaborate with you
                    to make an actionable plan on what we’ll tackle.
                </p>


                <p style="text-align: justify">
                    Second, we apply our industry expertise to challenge unverifiable, misleading, fraudulent and
                    erroneous items on your credit report. Following the unique plan we made in step one, we’ll contact
                    the credit companies directly to ensure they meet their obligations in relation to you and your
                    report.  Once favorable changes have been made by creditors, we then reach out to credit bureaus and
                    make certain that they have been updated with any changes.
                </p>
                <p style="text-align: justify">
                    Third, you receive your new and improved score—anda newfound sense of freedom to go with it.
                </p>

                </p>
                <p>
