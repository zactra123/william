        <p>“Debt means enslavement to the past, no matter how much you want to plan well for the future and live
            according to your own standards today. Unless you’re free from the bondage of paying for your past, you
            can’t responsibly live in the present and plan for the future.” - Tsh Oxenreider</p>
