                    <p style="text-align: justify">
                        The best way to keep your credit in tip-top shape is to avoid it from ever getting nasty in the
                        first place! Sure, this is much easier said than done. Let’s face it; life sometimes happens
                        before we’ve had a second even to breathe! With that said, if you follow these four tips
                        regularly, you won’t have to worry about your credit ever going down the drain, which means just
                        one less thing to worry about.
                    </p>

                    <h2>1.	Monitor Your Credit Score Regularly</h2>
                    <p style="text-align: justify">
                        How do you monitor your credit report? Did you know that
                        everyone can get a free credit report every year without affecting your credit score? Yup! It’s
                        the law. To do so, you need to head over to AnnualCreditReport.com and click on “Request your
                        free credit reports” located at the top of the page.
                    </p>
                    <p style="text-align: justify">
                        After filling in your contact information and verifying your identity, you can print out a
                        detailed report of your credit profile. It will detail all the current debts you have, their
                        balances, how often you pay on time, how often you have late payments, and whether you have any
                        bad debts such as collections.
                    </p>
                    <p style="text-align: justify">
                        Taking advantage of your free annual credit report is vital to keeping your credit score in
                        check. Doing so will help you identify errors before they get out of hand, keeps you informed on
                        how banks view your financial profile, and ultimately allows you to maintain a healthy credit
                        score.

                    </p>


                    <h2>2.	Make Your Debt Payments on Time</h2>
                    <p style="text-align: justify">
                        Perhaps the most common reason someone’s credit score drops are due to late payments. One late
                        payment can affect your score dramatically. Two late payments are even worse, and more than that
                        is just a downhill slipping slide.
                    </p>
                    <p style="text-align: justify">
                        Credit bureaus will identify how many payments are less than 30 days late and how many are less
                        than 60 days late. If it’s more than 60 days late, there’s a good chance to go to collections.
                        A perfect on-time payment history says novels to a bank about how likely you will repay a loan
                        when needed. This only increases your chances of getting help from major financial institutions
                        to purchase that dream home you’ve always wanted.

                    </p>

                    <h2>3.	Keep Your Balances Low</h2>
                    <p style="text-align: justify">
                        Another common issue that has a significant impact on how your credit is scored is your total
                        balances owed and, specifically, the average balances are of your revolving debt (credit cards
                        and lines of credit). If you keep your revolving credit balances above 30% - 50% of their total
                        credit limits, it’s negatively impacting your credit score and screams “SPENDER” to any bank
                        reviewing your profile to lend you money.

                    </p>
                    <p style="text-align: justify">
                        Keeping your total balances ideally below 30% of your total limit allows you to stay off the
                        radar in terms of holding high balances, while also allowing you to make monthly payments,
                        indicating you can keep making your payments on time.

                    </p>
                    <h2>4.	Dispute Credit Report Errors ASAP!</h2>
                    <p style="text-align: justify">
                        Upon regularly monitoring your credit, you’ll notice errors in your credit reports as soon as
                        they are updated. When you see something you don’t recognize on your credit report, the first
                        thing you should do is reach out to the company that owns that debt. You’ll often notice some
                        banks or lenders operate parts of their company under different names called a DBA (doing
                        business as). Upon reaching out to the company, if you find it’s still an error, your next step
                        is to reach out to credit bureaus immediately and dispute the mistake, or better yet, you will
                        hire a professional credit repair company such as Prudent Credit Solutions, Inc to handle that
                        matter swiftly on your behalf.
